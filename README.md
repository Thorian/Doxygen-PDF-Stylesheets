# Doxygen-PDF-Stylesheets
Documentation can be a pain, but its an important pain. This repository contains some stylesheets to make the PDF output of Doxygen a bit less painful.

## Thoughts and reasons ##
As a software developer I always run into the documentation nightmare.
Meaning i have to deliver some kind of nice handbook or documentation.
So i eneded up using DoxyGen and was more than unsatisfied with the results
I got from the generated PDF documentation.

This repository will be a collection of stylesheets i use for tuning
the LaTex output to something I'm proud to present.

## Usage ##
Download the stylsheet you like or download the whole package. Then name the stylesheet you want to use
using the LINUX_HEADER option in your DoxyGen File.
