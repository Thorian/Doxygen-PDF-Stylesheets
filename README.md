# Doxygen-PDF-Stylesheets
Documentation can be a pain, but its an important pain. This repository contains some stylesheets to make the PDF output of Doxygen a bit less painful.

## Thoughts and reasons ##
As a software developer I always run into the documentation nightmare.
Meaning i have to deliver some kind of nice handbook or documentation.
So i eneded up using DoxyGen and was more than unsatisfied with the results
I got from the generated PDF documentation.

This repository will be a collection of stylesheets i use for tuning
the LaTex output to something I'm proud to present.

## Usage ##
Download the stylsheet you like or download the whole package. Then name the stylesheet you want to use
using the LINUX_HEADER option in your DoxyGen File.

## Colors! Why Blue? I want a different one! ##
Please feel free to adjust the template color yourself its in the first few lines 
usually called colora colorb colorc and so on. You might aswell replace the company name
there which might come in handy as long as you don't work at H.I.E.
